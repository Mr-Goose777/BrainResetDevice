- Sequential Illumination: The LEDs light up in a specific sequence, illuminating either the right visual field or the left of both eyes.
- 40 Hz or 60 Hz frequency.
- Random Flickering Mode: random flickering of all four LEDs simultaneously.

The reason I built this are the following studies: 
Multi-sensory Gamma Stimulation Ameliorates Alzheimer’s-Associated Pathology and Improves Cognition   (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.014)
Non-invasive 40-Hz Light Flicker Ameliorates Alzheimer’s-Associated Rhythm Disorder via Regulating Central Circadian Clock in Mice   (https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00294)

Ketamine and flickering light bring youthful plasticity to older brains    (Science  By Nick Lavars July 06, 2021 )
Microglia enable mature perineuronal nets disassembly upon anesthetic ketamine exposure or 60-Hz light entrainment in the healthy brain (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109313)

The random mode is just randomly there to spice things up. Make it less repetative.

Don't worry about LED resistors. They are only on for 1ms or 500 microseconds, or running at very low PWM. seriously. Say NO to OCD. It will work fine. Trust me. NO TO OCD. YAY ✌️
